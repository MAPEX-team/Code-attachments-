# Introduction
The International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) is the leading international academic conference in machine learning. 
Along with NeurIPS and ICLR, it is one of the three primary conferences of high impact in machine learning and artificial intelligence research.

 This year, the conference took place in Vienna in July 2024. As of September 2024, many of the talks and resources are freely available at [ICML’s official website](https://icml.cc/).

 # Bonus Content
 Many intriguing lectures were presented at the conference, some of which, while not directly relevant to our current projects, I found to be particularly insightful. Below, I have provided links to two such lectures. If anyone discovers insights that could be applied to our projects, I would be happy to discuss them further.
